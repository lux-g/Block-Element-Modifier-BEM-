- its a methodology to writing HTML and CSS
- way to easily maintain the code

HTML
- you would start off with the Block with a class name of "card"
- all the Elements below it would be "card__something"
- the Modifier would be "card__something card__something--active"

CSS
- Block level first would be .card
- anything below that will be nested using &__something
 for the modifier you will use &--something
